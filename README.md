## Basic feature overview
Basic features to speed up progress or help test the game

V Enables/Disables flying with no collision

## Installation
Install [Melon Loader Installer](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader.Installer/blob/master/README.md#how-to-install-re-install-or-update-melonloader)

Select the game in the list or add a game manually

Enable Nightly builds

Pick 0.7.2-ci.2367 higher versions will probably work too, but idk

Click install

Drag the dll file and optionally the pdb file to <Game Dir>\Mods

And that's about it, first startup might take a little while, while il2cppdumper does its thing
